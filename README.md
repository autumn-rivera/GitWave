Welcome to rGit, a windows desktop application that lets you run recursive git commands and save them with notes. 

rGit is designed for developers who work with multiple git repositories and want to save tricky commands with notes. With rGit, you can:

- Run any git command on a single or multiple repositories with one click.

## Usage
rGit is easy to install and use. 

- Just download the latest release from the GitHub page and unzip in any folder. 
- Launch the application by running rGit.exe.
- Select the folder where git repositories are located, put a git command and click on run.

## Ideas for further improvements
- Add output about current command which is executed.
- Add button to choose run commands in cmd or in bash.
- Add formatting to outputs, e.g. different colors\font sizes etc.
- Implement config file, it's storage and choosing.
- Add question mark near to cmdVsBash button to explain what the difference and why it is needed.
